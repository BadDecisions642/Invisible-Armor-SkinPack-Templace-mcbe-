# Invisible-Armor-SkinPack-Templace-mcbe-
This Is a skinpack in which once given a png and imported hides your armor from people with "only allow trusted skins" turned off

Once imported find three skin files (png) of your choice and move them into the folder, rename them in order 1-3 (1, 2, 3,) if you want to edit the name of the pack open the manifest.json in a txt editor (visual studio code or notepad) and change the name (should be above uuid) and type in the name, too duplicate the skinpack (so you have two skinpacks with 3 skins) change the uuids in the manifest and then the skins pngs too
